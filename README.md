# CIEE Living Data Tutorials - Anticosti Historical Data
This repository contains an eco-evo tutorial developed by members of the [Canadian Institude of Ecology and Evolution](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/). The tutorials will use a canadian historical dataset from Anticosti Island durin a Hemlock looper outbreak in 1973. The dataset can be found on the government of Canada's official data portal.

Here is the link to the data:

And here is the link to the tutorial. The material was developed using the [learnr package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) and deployed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/):
