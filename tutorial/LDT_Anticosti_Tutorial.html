<h4>When you think of predator-prey interactions, what comes to mind?
Perhaps it is the emblematic hare and lynx example from the <a

Bay Company pelt-trading dataset</a>, or footage from nature
documentaries that showcase lions hunting zebras. But predator-prey
interactions are often less conspicuous, and yet still strongly impact
ecological communities. A great example are insect pests and their plant
prey. In this tutorial, we are going to explore an instance of this
interaction on Anticosti Island, Québec, between the hemlooper looper
(<em>Lambdina fiscellaria</em>) and the trees it predates upon.</h4>

<h4>The hemlock looper is a moth pest that is found <a
href="http://www.glfc.forestry.ca/VLF/ForumPresentations/heberthemlocklooper_08e.pdf">all
across Canada</a>, and parts of the USA, often as far south as the state
of Georgia. Since 1910, it has wreaked havoc in Québec’s forests.
Between 1910 and 1975, these outbreaks caused an estimated <a
href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambdina_fiscellaria">24 million
cubic meters of forest to be lost</a> in the province. Since then,
additional outbreaks have occurred across Québec in places like
Bas-Saint-Laurent, Gaspésie, and Anticosti Island.</h4>

and the Society for the Protection of Forests against Insects and
Diseases (<a href="https://sopfim.qc.ca/fr/">SOPFIM</a>) have been

extensive tree mortality events due to a hemlock looper outbreak from <a
href="https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/6856.pdf">1971-1973</a>.
As the hemlock looper larvae usually attacks mature tree stands by
eating their leaves, it causes them to appear <a

red-brown in color</a>, a tell-tale sign that an outbreak has

Forestry Centre</a>, and his student Michel Chabot (then going onto
becoming a forester in MFFP) went to Anticosti Island to visually survey
the degree of damage that the hemlock looper was causing. In their data,
openly hosted on the <a

of Canada’s website</a>, they denoted a tree as either being “good,”
meaning it did not show any signs of damage from the outbreak, “dead” if
the hemlock looper had attacked and killed the stand, and “questionable”
if they were unsure. This historical, and yet still very relevant
dataset, allows us to think about the impact pest outbreaks have on
ecological communities.</h4>

<h3>Let’s plot our actual data and see where the results lie, in
relationship to our guiding schematic above.</h3>
<p>We’ll start by filtering out the “Questionable” tree status, as it is
unclear if these trees will die as a result of the hemlock looper
outbreak. Then, we will calculate the total abundance of tree species by
plot, which were denoted as either “dead” or “alive.” With this, like we
did before, we will be able to calculate the abundance of a given
species relative to the abundance of all species within a plot.</p>

# Calculate the number of individuals of each species for each plot
tree_filter[, ind_sp_plot := sum(Number),
            by = .(Species, Plot, Compartment, Block)]

# Calculate the total abundance of individuals, irrespective of the species, in each plot
tree_filter[, total_id_plot := sum(unique(ind_sp_plot)),
            by = .(Plot, Compartment, Block)]

# Calculate the relative of each species in each plot
tree_filter[, rel_abund_plot := ind_sp_plot / total_id_plot]</code></pre>
<p>We then evaluate the count of “dead” trees per species, relative to
all individuals denoted as “dead,” across all plots :</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Calculate the total count of &quot;dead&quot; individuals by plot
tree_filter[Condition == &quot;Dead&quot;,
            total_dead := length(Condition),
            by = .(Plot, Compartment, Block)]

# Calculate the number of &quot;dead&quot; individuals per each species, for each plot

# Keep unique values with only &quot;dead&quot; rows and use this table for plotting

<h3>Factors to consider</h3>
<p>There is no one “right answer” to pest management, as it should be an
integrative, collaborative, and ever-evolving endeavor. However, having
data to drive these decisions is a powerful tool.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Although our data indicates that on Anticosti Island, the hemlock
looper had a preference for balsam fir in 1973, this is not its only or
main host. By directing management initiatives towards a
<strong>single</strong> tree species, this may cause other equally-liked
prey to be even more strongly attacked – this is a delicate balance to
strike. Likewise, this dataset is from the 20th century – would you
foresee predator-prey dynamics in Anticosti Island to have changed
since?</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a biological agent, like the fungi <em>Entomophthora</em> or
bacteria <em>Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki</em> (Btk) to control
hemlock looper seems like a sensible option. Perhaps you think this is
better than spraying a chemical insecticide. But biological agents are
controversial, as they can often have unintended consequences, impacting
species you did not wish to target. See this wonderful <a
href="https://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/invasivesseminar_readings/Simberloff_2012.pdf">paper</a>
that delves into this topic further.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Prevention is often be more effective than intervention.
Understanding the hemlock looper’s life history is a critical component
here – we know the larvae prefer certain species and more mature tree
stands. We can promote forests of a certain age and species composition,
and evenly spread out tree stands, to reduce the probability of a
hemlock looper outbreak in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>With all management initiatives, it is important to consult the
local community and have them integrally involved in the process, such
as the <a
href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1011203/unesco-cinq-communautes-innues-solidaires-danticosti">Innu
community on the North Shore</a>. Asking them what the want the forest
to look like and what they need, and not making these assumptions, can
help insure that pest management initiatives are ethical, sustainable,
and as such, a success.</li>
