#### Living Data Project - Maxime Fraser Franco (UQAM) and Victoria Marie Glynn (McGill)

Using real data from a devastating pest outbreak in Québec, we will begin to explore how **disturbance** in ecological communities impact:

- community composition
- diversity metrics
- species abundance curves

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think of predator-prey interactions, what comes to mind? Perhaps it is the emblematic hare and lynx example from the [Hudson's Bay Company pelt-trading dataset](https://jckantor.github.io/CBE30338/02.05-Hare-and-Lynx-Population-Dynamics.html), or footage from nature documentaries that show lions hunting zebras. But predator-prey interactions are often less conspicuous, and still strongly impact ecological communities. A great example are insect pests and their plant prey. In this tutorial, we are going to explore an instance of this interaction on Anticosti Island, Québec, between the hemlooper looper (*Lambdina fiscellaria*) and the trees it predates upon, and how this can reverberate throughout the greater beetle and lepidoptera community.

## **1. Getting to know our data**

### Let us begin by loading in the two datasets: 

#### First, let us call in the tree composition dataset, which we will call 'tree'


```{r, echo = TRUE}
tree <- read.csv("anticosti_1973_trees.csv", header = TRUE) 
```


#### Next, let us call in the beetle and lepidoptera biodiversity dataset, which we will call 'insect' 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
insect <- read.csv("microsigebready_carabeslepidoptera_anticosti_1993_en.csv", header = TRUE) 
```

Before beginning our analyses, it is great practice to quickly inspec the data and ask ourselves, is all the information we are looking for there? 

To do that, there are a handful of commands we can use:
