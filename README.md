# CIEE Living Data Tutorials - Anticosti Historical Data

The Living Data Tutorials (LDTs) were developed by graduate students in ecology and evolution during the spring of 2022 as part of the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution's [(CIEE)](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/data.html) Living Data Project (LDP). Our goal is to provide free and open-access teaching material in the form of online tutorials to undergraduate students in ecology and evolution. All the tutorials make use of publicly available Canadian datasets to address tailored topics in ecology and evolution. 

This tutorial uses a tree damage dataset from Anticosti Island during a hemlock looper outbreak in 1973. The dataset can be found on the government of Canada's official [data portal](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9dda09b0-649f-4002-b207-7b204eb81cbb). We would like to thank Anne Cotton-Gagnon, MSc, and Christian Hébert, PhD, from Natural Resources Canada and the Laurentian Forestry Centre for their insights on the original datasets and access to the reports and maps associated with such.

The tutorial was built with the free and open-source software environment [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using the [leanr package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) and and deployed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

The present tutorial was developed by Victoria Marie Glynn who is a PhD student at McGill University in Montréal, Québec, and Maxime Fraser Franco who is a PhD student at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM) in Montréal, Québec. Please feel free to contact us if you have any question.
