# CIEE Living Data Tutorials - Anticosti Historical Data

The Living Data Tutorials (LDTs) were developed by graduate students in ecology and evolution during the spring of 2022 as part of the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution's [(CIEE)](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/data.html) Living Data Project (LDP). Our aims were to provide free and open-access teaching material in the form of online tutorials for undergraduate students in ecology and evolution. All the tutorials make use of publicly available Canadian datasets to address specific topics in ecology and evolution. 

This tutorial uses a Canadian historical dataset from Anticosti Island during a Hemlock looper outbreak in 1973. The dataset can be found on the government of Canada's official data portal.

Here is the link to the data :

The tutorial was built with the free and open-source software environment [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using the [leanr package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) and and deployed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). You can find the project folders and files in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Living-Data-Tutorials/Anticosti-Historical-Data).
