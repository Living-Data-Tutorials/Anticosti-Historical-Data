# CIEE Living Data Tutorials - Anticosti Historical Data
This repository contains eco-evo tutorials developed by members of the [Canadian Institude of Ecology and Evolution](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/). The tutorials will use two canadian historical datasets from Anticosti Island. Both can be found on the government of Canada's official data portals.

The datasets are:
1. [Secondary insects and fungi post-hemlock looper on Anticosti in 1973](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9dda09b0-649f-4002-b207-7b204eb81cbb)
2. [Ground beetle and lepidoptera biodiversity on Anticosti in 1993](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/f55b476f-534f-4d4c-aacf-3088724cc5fd)
